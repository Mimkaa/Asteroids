# Asteroids!

## Ok, dived into my childhood and relaxed for a little while, this is a crappy copy of legendary Asteroids in pygame (crappy becase the way all images wrap around at boundaries does not work when any image hit 2 boundaries at once, but it is not very noticeable and I am lazy ...)

# Images
![This is a alt text.](/instances/ins1.png "This is a sample image.")
![This is a alt text.](/instances/ins2.png "This is a sample image.")
![This is a alt text.](/instances/ins3.png "This is a sample image.")
